	<h2>Why should I care?</h2>
	<p>A better question to ask would be, why shouldn't you care? This is the future of your children in the ballot of your vote. Imagine a Utopia where nobody is poor nobody has the upper hand and everybody is on an equal playing feild. Nobody is starving and nobdoy is homeeless and everybody benefits from everybody. The true meaning of a utopia!!!</p>
	<h2>How can I help?</h2>
	<p>Oprotunity to help is all around you, by persuading your fellow californians to join the cause and put a vote towards the california ressession bill and prop 14. We are more powerful together, and the best way we can fight off these capitalist demons is by taking a stand together as a republic.</p>
	<h2>What will change?</h2>
	<p>Nothing really... California already has many socialistic like props that have been passed in the past. Many legislations like: section 8 housing listing and high amounts of consitrated welfare. The California republic will be the socialist republic it was ment to be in a matter of no time. The only thing that will really change is your ability to travel to the rest of the mainland Untied States followed by the event called calexit.</p>
